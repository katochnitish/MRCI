<ul>

## Please use https://iirc.khu.ac.kr/toolbox.html for downloading  MRCI Toolbox for conductivity imaging using MRI as described in [Software Toolbox for Low-Frequency Conductivity and Current Density Imaging Using MRI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7994618). For CoReHa software, please use https://iirc.khu.ac.kr/CoReHa.html for downloading. 

MRCI is a free open source software toolbox package for electrical conductivity and current density image reconstruction using MRI data. It allows you to use multiple algorithms and state of the art in electromagnetic property imaging with conductivity phantom and human brain data. MRCI is a semiautomatic image reconstruction package run on Matlab and some functions need external software such as COMSOL Multiphysics otherwise mentioned in documentation. Future updates will be COMSOL free but for the time being a mesh file is provided with tutorials. If you are using toolbox or this document, please cite: **S. Z. K. Sajib, N. Katoch, H. J. Kim, O. I.
